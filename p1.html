    <p>The world fades to a darker color<br>
        Vision is blinded by depression.<br>
        Watching the tears dropping down<br>
        The sound of isolation.<br>
        <br><br><br>
        </p>
    <p class="center">
        I thought I will be drowned in a new world<br>
        But I was wrong.<br>
        Lack of realization<br>
        Short on realization.<br>
        <br><br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="right">
        I don’t know what I could have done to stay in the past.<br>
I understand the danger of soaking in memories<br>
They are on the east side of the map.<br>
I even miss the sound of mop swiping the wooden floor<br>
It was as noisy as a cry baby sucking bottle<br>
The sound of fraction: “gezhi…gezhi…”<br>
<br><br><br>
</p>
    <p>
        I miss the cuckoo that I saw with my telescope through the window<br>
And the sound of “BoGu.”<br>
I wake up with the scary alarm<br>
My heart rate increase.<br>
<br><br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        I am not focusing on The Moment<br>
I always think about the past.<br>
Life will no longer be held by warmth<br>
Everything is apart<br>
And held by anxiety.<br>
<br><br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="right">
        I try to find my memory here<br>
        Trying to adapt<br>
        the loneliness.<br>
        I am so excited to try the spicy dry pot<br>
        But the saltiness and spiciness are just not right<br>
        I am upset.<br>
        <br><br><br><a name="target1"></a>

    <div class="text1">
    
        I discover a new place that smells like “Lao gan ma” (a spicy topping)<br>
I walk in with curiosity<br>
I see my favorite spicy chicken on paper<br>
the image looks homey<br>
but I am wrong.<br>
<br><br><br>

</div>
    <p class="right">
        No place taste like mother’s special recipe.<br>
I walk on the street<br>
Hands in pockets.<br>
I get off the grey subway<br>
I swipe the red card to get back into my tiny dorm<br>
I am trapped.<br>

    </p>
    <div id="s1">
        <div id="img1"><img src="gif/g1.gif" width="500"></div>
I jump on to the bed<br>
Finally can get a rest<br>
But I knocked my knee on the white wall<br>
And disturbed by the “beep” of elevator.<br>
I sleep with harsh car break<br>
And the sound of subway tracks.<br>
My body is burning<br>
And my bones hurt<br>
Eyes are sore<br>
Feet are cold.<br>
<br><br><br>
    </div>
    <p class="right">
        I haven’t eaten since last morning<br>
I force my brain to drag my body up.<br>
I rub my feet against the floor<br>
I finally have something warm.<br>
The cold thermometer hits my armpit<br>
A body is trembling on bed.<br>
<br><br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        Black stars round and round<br>
Dizzy sound buzzs.<br>
I am asleep.<br>
And<br>
A normal day started<br>
Like travelling through the tunnel<br>
From darkness to brightness.<br>
<br><br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="right">
        From hopelessness to hopefulness<br>
        The arch hovers on top<br>
        It presses me down and erode me<br>
        Till I can’t breathe.<br>
        It protects me from collapsing.<br>
        <br><br><br><a name="target3"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="text3">
        I go through the tunnel<br>
        It is Absorbing me.<br>
        I travel through time<br>
        I travel through space<br>
        And I travel through myself. <br>

        My mum opened the door and shook my body.<br>
        I opened my eyes<br>
        and saw the familiar white closet.<br>
        I stretched my body<br>
        and flipped to another side.<br>
        <br><br><br>
    </div>

        I had family breakfast with steam dumplings<br>
        I was expecting lamb with carrot last night<br>
        My mother totally got my appetite.</p>
        <p class="right">
        Every morning was a surprise for my stomach<br>
        There was no tedious thing to take up my delighted brain.</p>
        <p class="right">
        I walked through Hutong<br>
        to sit in lines.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        I had spicy dry pot at the school restaurant with Barbara<br>
        The soft konjaku<br>
        The crunchy greens<br>
        The red spice<br>
        The vinegar topping<br>
        And it was perfect with hot rice.</p>
        <p class="center">
        <br>
        <br>
        I walked across the hutong<br>
        to sit in lines again.</p>
        <p class="center">
        I fell asleep at literature class<br>
        while Ms. Fourquean was reading “The Bait”</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        I dreamed about growing up<br>
        and having lectures in college<br>
        Excitement filled my brain.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="right">
        I opened the glass door and entered the password<br>
        While smelling the hot chicken soup that takes 5 hours to stew<br>
        Hot steam of fresh chicken corn and seaweed covered my eyes.</p>
        <p class="right">
        I woke up at “6:30”<br>
        And walked through the Hutong again<br>
        Carrying a 1000 pages calculus textbook<br>
        I said goodbye and see you in the afternoon<br>
        when I got off the car.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br><a name="target6"></a>
        <p>
        We ran 800 meter in PE class<br>
        I tasted the blood in my throat<br>
        Telling myself it was the last lap.</p>
        <div class="text2">
        I put my exhausted arm on Barbara’s shoulder<br>
        Her height is perfect to relax.</div>
        <p>
        We had Green Scream (an energy drink)<br>
        in the small market next to our building<br>
        And sneaked inside.</p>
        <p>
        I bend over on my desk<br>
        My legs are sore<br>
        I could still feel the sickness.</p>
        <p class="right">
        <br>
        <br>
        I had rice noodle in classroom instead<br>
        It was the first time I finished the big serve<br>
        It healed my exhaustion.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="center">
        It was rainy when we heard the ring<br>
        But we all couldn’t wait to get back home<br>
        Raindrops dropped in my eyes<br>
        I was supposed to arrive home<br>
        But I didn’t.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="center">
        It is a dream<br>
        The raindrops are tears rushing the shore.</p>
        <br>

        <div class="s3">
            <div id="img4"><img src="gif/g1.3.gif" width="300"></div>
        I question the reality<br>
        I don’t want to believe in it.<br>
        Or I am right.<br>
        I doubt my ability<br>
        I doubt the future.<br>
        Smoke around my eyes<br>
        I am breathing hard.<br>
        Am I falling into an abyss of consciousness&#63;<br>
        Or the feeling of missing.<br></div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="center">
        What if I am a child who was abandoned by her own past&#63;</p>
        <p class="center">
        What if I can’t wake up again&#63;</p>
        <p class="center">
        What if the shining stars on the ocean disappear and there won’t be any glitter on the ocean waves&#63;</p>
        <p class="center">
        What if the warm fire surrounding me extinguished before I am strong enough to face<br>
        The Darkness&#63;</p>
