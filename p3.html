        Regret for the moment that I pressed the bottom-restore, unknown of the future. <br>
        Memories are the only thing a person can leave in the heart, never recovered or deleted.<br>
        -whatâ€™s actually the purpose of saving photos on phone but never check them or print it? <br>
        Why not just leave the best moment in your heart-<br>

To accomplish your life goals, u gotta look up all the time and keep on going for no reason.<br>
 No matter what. Tiredness, fear, or even pain and tears. <br>
 Remember nothing can stop u from being what u are in the deepest corner of ur heart.

There is no need to complain and blame all the things that u can't affect and control, it is not worth it to warn the suck. <br>
Learn from the optimistic, learn from the fact and hidden truth.
