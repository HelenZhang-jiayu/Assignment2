        PAST
    </div>
<div class="text2">You said  it is hard to leave the past,<br>
        But new journey weren’t that bad.<br>
        Apparently it still has a path that leads to the end,<br>
        But the journey seems to be ended.<br>
</div>
<div class="text3">You grabbed me out of the abyss,<br>
    And convinced me to leave my new past.<br>
    Your promise pledges in a tale<br>
    And there won’t be excitements for bed time story.<br>

<div class="text4">
    You raised me upon the sky,<br>
And I saw brilliant kites<br>
But no one fight through soreness<br>
And your arms bend eventually.<br>
</div>
<div class="text5">
    <div id="img2"><img src="gif/g2.2.gif" width="400"></div>
    You said you love me no more,<br>
But no one can handle it and they all mourn.<br>
Everything starts like a dream and I woke up in a sudden drop,<br>
Light shine no more,<br>
Desperation died for more.<br>
</div>
<div class="text6">
    I fell in a deeper root, <br>
May be delighted no more.<br>
